2. Illness Count**: Determine the total number of people based on their illness count.
3. Income Analysis**: Visualize and analyze maximum, minimum, and median income.
4. Activity Reduction**: Analyze the number of days of reduced activity for males and females due to illness.
5. Missing Values**: Visualize missing values in the dataset using a heat map.
6.   Correlation Analysis**: Find correlations between variables in the dataset.
7. Income vs. Hospital Visits**: Analyze how a patientâ€™s income affects the number of visits to the hospital.
8. Gender Analysis**: Count and visualize the number of males and females affected by illness.
9. Insurance Analysis**: Visualize the percentage of people receiving government health insurance due to low income and old age versus those with private health insurance.
10. Reduced Activity by Gender**: Plot a horizontal bar chart to analyze reduced days of activity due to illness based on gender.
Importance
