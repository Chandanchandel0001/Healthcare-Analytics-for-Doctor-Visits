Google Colab**: For data analysis and visualization using Python.

Key Questions Addressed
1. Dataset Overview**: Read the dataset and display detailed information about columns, including names, counts, data types, and memory usage.
2. Illness Count**: Determine the total number of people based on their illness count.
3. Income Analysis**: Visualize and analyze maximum, minimum, and median income.
4. Activity Reduction**: Analyze the number of days of reduced activity for males and females due to illness.
5. Missing Values**: Visualize missing values in the dataset using a heat map.
6.   Correlation Analysis**: Find correlations between variables in the dataset.
7. Income vs. Hospital Visits**: Analyze how a patient’s income affects the number of visits to the hospital.
8. Gender Analysis**: Count and visualize the number of males and females affected by illness.
9. Insurance Analysis**: Visualize the percentage of people receiving government health insurance due to low income and old age versus those with private health insurance.
10. Reduced Activity by Gender**: Plot a horizontal bar chart to analyze reduced days of activity due to illness based on gender.
Importance
This analysis provides valuable insights that can help healthcare providers tailor their services to meet the needs of patients effectively, ultimately enhancing patient care and improving health outcomes.
